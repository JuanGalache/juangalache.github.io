        <br>
        <h2 class="ame">An app designed for my thesis work. Its aim is to help people to spend effectively their time in the kitchen and teach what to cook in order to have a healthy nourishment.</h2>
        <h2 class="amen">Ideation Process</h2>
        <h2 class="ame">The premise of the thesis was to think about the future of healthy nourishment and make it profitable for Peabody. But to be able to develop a future scenario, it was important to first understand what does it means to have a healthy dieting. Using UX Research, I conducted interviews to experts like nutritionists and made a survey to gather information and understand the user's daily challenges about having a healthy dieting. After the research process and cross-checking information, I came out with a clear and concise definition about what it means to "eat healthy" and a high understanding of the people's pain points on their desire to carry out a healthy nourishment.</h2>
        <h2 class="ame">Using my Product, Service and UX/UI Design Skills, my proposal was the creation of an app that helps the user to develop a healthy habit by implementing a series of short term benefits that encourages the user to be healthy by utilizing the culinary appliances of Peabody.</h2>
